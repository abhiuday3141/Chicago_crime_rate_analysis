# Chicago_crime_rate_analysis

## About the Project
In This Project I have analysed the chicago crime data set from 2005-2007 and 2012-2017 Dataset link:https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8
Through data analysis and exploration I have analysed various stuff about the city of Chicago and the crime-rate there

## Library Used
For the Future prediction and analysis I have used Facebook open-source software Prophet. This gave me an accurate prediction of the crime rate and other functionalities
Other than this Numpy,Pandas, etc Libraries were also used

## Inferences
1) The crime-rate increases in the months that have moderate temperature since cold-weather forces people to sit at home lowering the crime-rate
2) The chicago government has worked upon loweringdown the crime-rate as can be seen from the graphs of 2005-2007 and 2012-2017
3) The most Crimes occur at the streets and the Crime that occurs the most are Thefts which makes sense since its a wide-variety
4) We see a sudden decline in crime-count in the end of 2017 which verifies many news articles such as this one https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-chicago-idUSKBN1EQ18F

## HOW TO RUN
Just download the IPYNB file the data-set in the same directory and the it will work just fine
